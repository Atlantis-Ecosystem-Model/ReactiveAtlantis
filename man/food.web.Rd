\usage{
food.web(diet.file, grp.file, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{diet.file}{Character string with the path to the Diet output file. This
file contains the diets of each functional group at each (recorded) time
step. If the Atlantis simulation is for several years, it is highly
recommended that a low frequency of recording of this output is used (set
using toutinc) otherwise file sizes can become substantial (which can be
very difficult to handle in R).}

\item{grp.file}{Character string with the path to the groups \emph{*.csv} file (Atlantis input file).}

\item{quiet}{(Default = TRUE) this parameter helps during the process of debugging.}
}
\value{
Reactive output with the plot of the food web for the specific time step,
    and a table with the trophic level of each prey and predator in the food web
}
\description{
This function allows you to explore the changes in the food web structure and
    trophic level for an specific functional group through time. The estimation
    of the trophic position is based on the approach of Pauly \emph{et al.}(1998)
    \deqn{TL_{i}  = 1  +  \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^{n}(DC_{i, j}  *  TL_{j})}{\sum_{j = 1}^{n} DC_{i, j}}}
were \eqn{TL_{i}} in the trophic position of the predator, \eqn{DC_{i, j}} is the diet composition; \eqn{TL_{j}} is the trophic level of the
    prey,  and n in the number of preys. These initial values for the trophic position were based on Pauly \emph{et
    al.} (1998) and Tucker and Roger (2014) (Table 1).

    The flexibility of this function allows you to change: a) \bold{the \emph{focus}
    functional group} over which all calculations would be made; b) \bold{Maximum
    trophic connection}, this allows for simplification of the food-web and the
    setting of the maximum number of connections from the focus functional group;
    c) \bold{the minimum proportion}, which sets the minimum proportion of a
    functional group in a diet that is considered as prey for the analysis; and
    d) \bold{time step} which sets the time step for the calculation of the food-web.
