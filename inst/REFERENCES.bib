abstract = {Functional reactive programming (FRP) has simple and powerful semantics, but has resisted efficient implementation. In particular, most past implementations have used demand-driven sampling, which accommodates FRP's continuous time semantics and fits well with the nature of functional programming. Consequently, values are wastefully recomputed even when inputs don't change, and reaction latency can be as high as the sampling period. This paper presents a way to implement FRP that combines data- and demand-driven evaluation, in which values are recomputed only when necessary, and reactions are nearly instantaneous. The implementation is rooted in a new simple formulation of FRP and its semantics and so is easy to understand and reason about. On the road to a new implementation, we'll meet some old friends (monoids, functors, applicative functors, monads, morphisms, and improving values) and make some new friends (functional future values, reactive normal form, and concurrent "unambiguous choice").},

abstract = {Models are key tools for integrating a wide range of system information in a common framework. Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to ‘road test’ management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade-offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time. Although it is doubtful that any single management action will be based solely on Atlantis, this modelling approach continues to provide important insights for managers when making natural resource management decisions.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes of d13C and d15N were used to examine food sources and trophic structure of 65 taxa, represent- ing 19 ecological groups, in a high-latitude ecosystem. Discrimination was made between pelagic and benthic carbon sour- ces, where feeding in most cases reflected the habitat. Trophic levels from these analyses, TLN, were compared with corresponding levels estimated by an Ecopath mass-balance model, TLE, constructed independently of the isotope data. The good correlation between the two methods (r2 = 0.72) supports the diet composition and the grouping of taxa into eco- logical groups in the model. However, when estimates diverged, this was often explained by the analyses of few taxa, taxa that were not the most representative for the group, or the analyses of specimens from a limited size range. Some assumed detrivores were assigned high TLN in favour of an abundant microbial community in the sediments. High TLN estimates for many invertebrate taxa, combined with relatively low TLN for fishes, suggest that parts of the benthic food web are de- coupled from the classical food web.},

Diet was apportioned among eight categories of prey types (benthic invertebrates, large zooplankton, small squids, large squids, small pelagic ﬁshes, mesopelagic ﬁshes, miscellaneous ﬁshes and higher invertebrates). Trophic levels were estimated for each species of marine mammals and compared with published estimates derived using stable isotope ratios. Trophic levels ranged from 3.2–3.4 in baleen whales and sea otters, to 3.8–4.4 in most pinnipeds and odontocete whales, to 4.5–4.6 in killer whales. Such information can be used for ecosystem modelling and related studies.},

@article{Post2002,
abstract = {Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Corson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853 USA. Institute for Ecosystem Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, New York 12545 USA  The stable isotopes of nitrogen ($\delta$15N) and carbon ($\delta$13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of $\delta$15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of $\delta$13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of $\delta$15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of $\delta$13C when $\delta$13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.
